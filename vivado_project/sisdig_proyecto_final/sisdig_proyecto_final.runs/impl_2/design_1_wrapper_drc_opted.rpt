RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/main_0/U0/vram_inst/ram_reg_0 has an input control pin design_1_i/main_0/U0/vram_inst/ram_reg_0/ADDRBWRADDR[0] (net: design_1_i/main_0/U0/vram_inst/addr_rd[0]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/main_0/U0/video_driver_inst/vram_addr_rd_current_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.

The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/main_0/U0/vram_inst/ram_reg_1 has an input control pin design_1_i/main_0/U0/vram_inst/ram_reg_1/ADDRBWRADDR[12] (net: design_1_i/main_0/U0/vram_inst/addr_rd[12]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/main_0/U0/video_driver_inst/vram_addr_rd_current_reg[12]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
